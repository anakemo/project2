                 <h4 class="h4aboutusArticle1">The Pisco Chilcano has eclipsed the Pisco Sour as Perus most popular cocktail</h4>
                 <p class="paboutusArticle1">heres no doubt that the Pisco Sour is omnipresent in Peru. In Lima, tourists clamor to order the national drink served at legendary watering holes like the historic Gran Hotel Bolívar, while supermarkets dedicate entire sections to pre-mixed versions.

                    The story goes that the national drink was crafted by a Lima bartender who had run out of whiskey and decided to swap pisco into the Whiskey Sour template. Since then, the unaged brandy has served as the base spirit for dozens of variations on classics, like the Cholopolitan, which uses the Cosmopolitans key ingredients of orange liqueur and cranberry juice but substitutes vodka with pisco, or the El Capitán, a pisco-based take on the Manhattan. 
                    
                    But one easy-drinking cocktail has risen so much in popularity that it has now eclipsed Perus national drink. The Pisco Chilcano, made with pisco, ginger ale, lime juice and Angostura bitters, is light and bright and as easy to make as it is to drink. 
                    
                    “When Italian migrants first came to Peru, they brought various things—including grappa, the Italian spirit made from grapes,” says Fiorella Larrea, master mixologist at the Belo Bar at Belmonds Miraflores Park Hotel in Lima. “They used it to make a drink made with ginger ale, but later substituted grappa with pisco, which made it fresher and easier to prepare, because grappa wasnt really [widely] available here at that time. They called it a Chilcano because it had the same golden color as a Peruvian fish soup with the same name.”

                    To understand the classic, bar manager Miguel Lancha has taken the drink to two extremes: stripped down and geeked out.

                    Mastering the Pisco Sour With Lynnette Marrero
                    In "Masters of X," we spotlight bartenders chasing perfection in one drink. Here, Lynnette Marrero on the overlooked Pisco Sour.
                    
                    Fast-forward to today, and this simple cocktail is giving the Pisco Sour a run for its money. “The Chilcano is definitely the most popular pisco drink in Peru, simply because it s so refreshing,” says Angie Alave Armas, bar manager at Houlihan s, a popular Irish pub in downtown Lima. Although the Chilcano is equally popular with locals, the absence of egg white plays a key role in attracting tourists who are keen to try pisco, but weary of the frothy Pisco Sour. “Many of them find it weird that we ve got this cocktail made with egg,” Armas says. 
                    
                    Like the Pisco Sour, the Pisco Chilcano has gone through its own evolution—a range of fruit liqueurs, spices and herbs are now common additions to the format. One of the most popular drinks at Houlihan s, for example, is the passion fruit Chilcano. Bar Inglés in the Country Club Lima Hotel, meanwhile, puts a spin on the drink with its Pisco Chilcano de Guinda, in which cherry liqueur adds tart sweetness to the classic, and at the Belo Bar, Larrea has prepared Pisco Chilcanos with macerated fruit, hibiscus and lemongrass, although she admits to a weakness for a version made with grilled bell peppers. “You get this delicius, tequila-like smokiness,” she says. Others put a simpler twist on the drink: Barra 55, a cocktail bar in Lima s Barranco neighborhood, swaps the requisite Angostura for orange bitters for an extra citrusy kick. 
                    
                    But even the simplest preparations can be the most refreshing, and the ease with which the drink can be thrown together is key to its appeal. The Pisco Sour, typically served in a coupe glass, with its precisely applied dots of Angostura bitters resting on a perfectly whisked layer of egg white, comes with an aura of sophistication. But the Pisco Chilcano, a tall drink made with ingredients that don t necessarily need to be mixed or added in any particular order, takes itself far less seriously. “It s a party drink,” says Larrea. “If you go to a party in Peru, this is what people will be drinking.”</p>

                 <h4 class="h4aboutusArticle1">Inspired by “Dirty Bertie,” the scandal-prone Crown Prince of Britain, the Victorian-era combination of rye, pineapple and Champagne is the perfect canvas for experimentational</h4>
                 <p class="paboutusArticle1">s the British crown prince for nearly six decades, Albert Edward, the eldest son of Queen Victoria, spent much of his life traveling the world as an official representative of the crown, from the United States and Canada to the Mediterranean and Middle East. Less officially, Bertie, as he was known by most, also snogged his way across several continents, amassing dozens of mistresses and shaping culture and fashion for the leisure class in Europe. He is also the probable inventor of, and certainly the inspiration behind, the Prince of Wales cocktail. 

                    Though a bit of an obscurity today, the drink, which first appears in print in a 1901 biography of Bertie after he was crowned King Edward VII, was a success at the time of its creation. David Wondrichs Imbibe relates that the prince was “credited” with the composition of the cocktail—a mixture of rye, pineapple, cherry liqueur and Champagne—and that it was quite popular at the private clubs frequented by the fashionable elites of the day. Bertie himself belonged to at least five different London gentlemen s clubs, and was known to have a particular penchant for Champagne. He regularly carried it with him in a jug to sip at his leisure, and apparently ordered a bath filled with the stuff during visits to his private quarters in one of Paris  most distinguished brothels. Its no surprise, then, that the sparkling wine would make an appearance in his namesake cocktail. 
                    
                    Berties sexual exploits were as legendary as his taste for Champagne. Also dubbed “Dirty Bertie” and “Edward the Caresser,” his very first scandal came when the 19-year-old prince visited Ireland on a school trip, and was caught smuggling actress Nellie Clifden into his tent. His subsequent mistresses included Jennie Churchill, eventual mother of Winston; acclaimed actress Sarah Bernhardt; and a series of Parisian courtesans. His official mistress for the final 13 years of his life was Alice Keppel, great-grandmother to Camilla Parker Bowles, the current queen consort. 
                    
                    By his later years, Albert had become rather portly as a result of frequent rich meals. This presented him with a bit of a challenge in certain departments, but not even the laws of physics were able to stop his insurmountable appetite. He commissioned a French cabinetmaker to create the “Siège  ,” also known as the Sex Chair, to accommodate his expanded waistband as well as two women.

                    RECIPE
                    The Prince of Wales
                    The lavish cocktail named after Queen Victoria's eldest son.
                    
                    His eponymous cocktail is a perfect amalgam of his travels, his interests and the world he lived in. The drink itself originally comprised rye, pineapple, maraschino liqueur and bitters, plus sugar and Champagne, doubling as both an Improved Whiskey Cocktail and a royale. With the right combination of rye, bitters and bubbles, the drink can be a complex showcase of skill.
                    
                    The Prince of Wales cocktail is also a great canvas for ingredient-swapping. In fact, variations of the drink have appeared in cocktail compilations for decades since it was first recorded. The How and When, a 1937 Chicago guide to spirits and cocktail recipes, substitutes gin for the rye and adds an egg white. Charles H. Baker s 1951 The South American Gentleman s Companion features gin, Cognac, lemon, egg white and pineapple juice. Madeira is another popular primary spirit; in fact, Mr. Boston s version marries Madeira, brandy, triple sec, bitters and Champagne, omitting pineapple entirely. 
                    
                    Bertie would likely be unfazed, maybe even delighted, by the long life and many variants of the Prince of Wales. After 59 years as king-in-waiting, Albert Edward finally ascended the throne as King Edward VII and reigned for just over nine years, from 1901 to 1910. His lavish lifestyle was the eventual death of him: Decades of rich food and drink wreaked havoc on his stomach and heart. His final words, on being told that his favorite horse had just won a race, spoke for a life lived raucously and joyously: “Yes, I have heard of it. I am very glad.”</p>
